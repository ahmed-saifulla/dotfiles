# dotfiles
Personal configuration files. These configs have come from various sources.
I have tried to allude the sources at appropriate places. 
If anything has been left out, it's due to my negligence, please feel free to point out.

## Installation
copy this into your shell.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rmNULL/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you don't want any file/directory to be copied rm it before running `./install.sh`
